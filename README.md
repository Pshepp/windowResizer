# windowResizer

Since windows 8.1 does not have any elegant ways to automaitcally place windows on all monitors I decided to create my own program that does so. When run this program checks all connected monitors and then places open application windows accordingly.

## Issues

Due to a drive failure this is not the finalized version but a version I had laying around on one of my drives. I need to add the functionality back where one can have certain programs have a higher priority and thus those programs will occupy a larger portion of the screens. Furthermore need to repolish the program in general.
